# Fraud Detection System


## 📌 Problem Statement

Fraudulent transactions represent a very small fraction of total financial activity but cause significant financial loss.
The main challenge is **extreme class imbalance**, where fraud cases account for less than 1% of all transactions, making traditional accuracy-based models ineffective.

This project aims to build a robust fraud detection system that prioritizes:

* Recall (catching fraud)
* Precision (reducing false alarms)
* Real-world deployment readiness

---

## 📊 Dataset

* **Source:** Kaggle – Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset
* **Transactions:** ~284,000
* **Fraud Rate:** ~0.17%
* **Features:** PCA-transformed numerical features (`V1–V28`)
* **Target Variable:** `Class`

  * `0` → Normal transaction
  * `1` → Fraudulent transaction

The raw dataset is stored untouched to preserve data integrity.

## ✅ Progress So Far (Week 1)

### ✔ Data Setup & Exploration

* Initialized a production-ready project structure
* Loaded and validated the dataset
* Verified extreme class imbalance
* Explored transaction `Amount` and `Time` features
* Visualized fraud vs non-fraud distributions
* Confirmed absence of missing values

### ✔ Engineering Foundations

* Created reusable data-loading functions inside `src/`
* Separated exploratory notebooks from production code
* Addressed Python import paths for scalable development

### ✔ Key Insights

* Fraud cases represent less than 1% of all transactions
* Transaction amounts are heavily right-skewed
* Fraud behavior differs significantly from normal transactions
* Accuracy alone is not an appropriate evaluation metric
