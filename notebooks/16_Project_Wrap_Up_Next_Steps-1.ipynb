    "This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions in an extremely imbalanced dataset where fraud represents less than 1% of all transactions.\n",

    "The primary objective was to build a model that:\n",
    "\n",
    "Maximizes fraud detection (recall)\n",
    "\n",
    "Controls false positives (precision)\n",
    "\n",
    "Is suitable for real-world deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "A full end-to-end machine learning workflow was implemented, from data exploration to final model selection."
